hi doctor 
gosh i dont know 
there is so much swirling around in my head 
i saw dr halsey again 
did he speak to you 
i dont know where to start 
lets see 
he went over some of the medical reports and his findings 
a lot of that medical technical mumbo jumbo that doctors are so fond of using half of which i just drone out after time 
then he told me he had a diagnosis 
i was so shocked and surprised i mean i have only seen him a few times 
i have spent so many years seeing so many doctors it seemed hard to believe that he could find an answer so easily and quickly 
anyway i didnt know if i should cry or be happy or scream 
after all these years to finally have a diagnosis a name to put to all this stuff my body goes through of course its a relief 
but i was almost scared to hear what he was going to say 
as he probably told you i have something called chronic fatigue syndrome 
he promised me he would get some literature on it so i can learn more 
he suggested i find a support group as well so i can talk to other people who are going through the same thing 
its all so weird and overwhelming 
oh i dont know 
there was way too much to absorb all in one sitting 
now that i have this i want to know what i can do to fix it to be better 
i dont know what it means in terms of planning out my life goals 
i dont even know if it is contagious 
or how i got this in the first place 
id rather just know how to get rid of it 
it seems i have more unanswered questions than when i started 
i am so grateful that for all of his support knowledge and patience 
i am confused about the name of this illness though 
chronic fatigue 
does that mean i just need more sleep i know there are days when i feel like i can sleep forever but it doesnt seem to get rid of my symptoms 
actually i wouldnt even say fatigue is my chief complaint 
sure its annoying and i am always so tired and wiped out 
but there is so much more 
yes a little 
but quite honestly i dont recall very much 
shell shock i guess 
he said something about my white blood cell count being irregular 
is this related to aids isnt that the problem in aids patients 
cfs is that an abbreviation for chronic fatigue syndrome 
hmm 
well how will this affect my work i got a letter from ms 
bows the other day 
i guess the office has noticed my absences 
now there is a letter in my file 
i cant believe it i do so much around there 
i try so hard to do well at work and now i have this haunting me 
what if i need to take more time off from work in the future i cant tell you how many times i have covered for people 
jeez i wonder which rat squealed on me 
i dont think ms bows has that much of a problem with my work 
when she does she usually is up front about it 
she will say something right then and there 
oh my that reminds me 
did you hear she was in the hospital i couldnt believe it in the maternity ward no less 
wow 
i stopped by the hospital to visit her and bring her some flowers 
she has always been kind to me and i know what it is like to be ill 
i couldnt get in to see her but they said she had been admitted into the maternity ward 
that is pretty cool 
but she sure wasnt showing or anything 
i cant imagine why shes there but i just hope everything is okay with her pregnancy if shes pregnant 
i wonder if she will take leave and for how long 
im sorry doctor 
i am rambling and jumping all over the place with my thoughts arent i 
no 
do you think i need to tell them about this cfs business come to think of it i dont know how to tell anyone about it 
what do i say hi how are you doing things are pretty much the same 
oh by the way i have this disease called chronic fatigue syndrome and the doctors dont know much about itâ€¦ 
no 
i almost called michelle but she is due to visit during the last weekend in september 
i would rather discuss it with her in person than over the phone 
i dont know what to tell brian 
and my parents have been out of town this past week 
okay 
i guess i need to learn more 
im almost afraid of what i might find out 
that there is no hope 
that i am going to linger like this forever 
weird but i dont fear dying 
maybe because it seems so simple in comparison to the suffering 
not that i am considering suicide doctor 
i want you to know that 
its nice to know that this is not all in my head 
i cant believe it 
id love to take him around to every idiot who claimed i was making all this up 
i guess that is one thing that is normal about me i have been doing a lot of crying lately 
i cant help but feel a sense of helplessness when i think about my life 
do you remember that woman who used the assisted suicide doctor not too long ago the one who i spoke to you about and had similar symptoms she had this thing this cfs 
god that is so scary what kind of message does it say about this disease my future what i have to look forward to what is to become of me 
can i have a moment 
i think i am going to start crying again 
does it have any side effects 
that seems reasonable 
will it also help this nagging fear and impending doom i have 
oh good 
as much as i hate taking pills i hate feeling this way even more 
im sorry i have been such a pain in the butt 
i guess that is one of those easier said than done bits of advice huh doc i cant wait until the weekend 
i need a break from everything 
i wish i could just run away and escape leave all my problems behind 
i guess ill get my chance when michelle is in town 
meantime i am going to soak myself in a nice long epsom salt bath 
dr halsey said the epsom salt helps to soothe aching muscles and joints 
and i think i will play some cool music in the bathroom 
a real calgon take me away kind of night 
is there some way we can talk without me having to come in every week i think talking things out with you is really helpful but now that i have to be more careful about work 
very agreeable 
but can we make it later on in the evening that way i dont have to call from work 
thats perfect 
thanks doctor 
i understand 
ill give you a call if i notice anything strange 
bye 
i almost didnt
but i really needed to talk
i had to take a cab over because i am not feeling all that well today
in fact i missed work
i left a message in the office and a separate one for ms bows
i really want to explain to her that i am not just loafing off
i mean if i lose my job i lose my job
i am not quite on a lucky streak right now
and i have other things on my mind
but i respect her as well as admire her and i dont want to disappoint her
yes i suppose
i dont know
doctor if i lose my job will you still be able to see me as a therapist i mean
i know i am in an hmo and that you have a special relationship with the company
jeez
it was quite crazy
michelle called because she is coming in this weekend
she had all these massive plans for us and wanted to share them with me
she called on a very bad day for me
i couldnt think straight
it was horrible
she asked me if everything was okay
so i started to cry
i feel like such a failure
well she asked me what was wrong so i told her i wasnt feeling too well
she then said that she hoped i would be feeling better for her visit since she had all these exciting things planned
what could i tell her i dont know if i am going to get any better
i dont know if i am going to get worse
heck i dont think the doctors know a damned thing more than i do at this point i couldnt stop crying
i finally asked her if i could call her back
she replied yea for you she knew how frustrating it was for me to be ill and not know what was wrong with me
she always believed that when i had a diagnosis a cure or treatment would shortly follow
she was so bummed for me
someone who is truly supportive and wants to hear the whole story
she is even going to call the cdc and try to get some more information
that pissy girls reaction still haunts me
if a friend acted like she did
i think i would hide in a hole forever
he asked what it all meant
then he asked me if that is why i wont sleep with him
i mean he was so forthright about it all
i need some space some time to figure everything out
im not sure
which means i should just end things already
but right now he is willing to have me and i am not sure i will get to be so lucky again
well considering i have this illness chronic fatigue syndrome
did you know that isnt even the real name it is called chronic fatigue and immune dysfunction syndrome
in japan they call it killer cell syndrome because it destroys the immune system
in canada and the united kingdom its called myalgic encephalomyelitis
actually i am not sure if i have that name exactly right it is quite the mouthful
ive never liked the name chronic fatigue syndrome it makes it sound like youre just sleepy or something
did you know florence nightingale was rumored to have this illness in her later years 
she has had cfids for five years or so
oh thats what they call it chronic fatigue and immune dysfunction syndrome
cfids
anyway with the diagnosis procedure so crazy she isnt quite certain about the onset
anyway she has two young girls and a husband
she is totally bedridden at this point
she had been working part time and taking care of the house
she just got sicker and sicker and then one day couldnt get out of bed
her children leave some food and an icebox by her bed before they leave for school
her husband calls around lunch time to check on her
then when the girls come home they begin preparing dinner
she has to schedule her bathroom visits around who is going to be in the house with her
my apartment is very lovely and spacious
thanks
oh well
thanks
thanks again
much better
its like i can feel the fluids drain right out of my body and my temperature skyrocket
very weird
no not yet
at first he wanted to refer me to this big wig specialist
but he doesnt accept any insurance and expects cash up front
to top that off he charges $ and up for a round of blood tests and a $ consultation fee for the first minutes
he doesnt accept patients unless he has personally diagnosed them
then he charges $ for a follow up visit where he explains what his findings are
after that visits are $ for a fifteen minute visit or phone consultation
the nerve here he is dealing with a group of desperate patients many whom cannot work and have already spent life savings on doctors and tests and phony cures and he is ready to bleed them dry ugh
i can not respect that
yeah hes a nice guy
i get so nervous around most doctors i dont trust them more than i could throw them
but you and he are actually human
yes
can i borrow the phone to call a cab to take me back home 
thanks doctor
have a good week
bye
the side effects subsided 
sometimes it is hard to tell because of the symptoms i normally have 
i mean it can be difficult to differentiate between my normal sickness and the reactions to the drug
it was quite busy actually
it was like something in me was screaming,
i am alive i am alive
i did get up for one quick performance which was totally cool 
so i said i have chronic fatigue syndrome 
i couldnt believe how wonderful the evening began and how awful it ended people can be so ignorant and closed minded and cruel i just dont get it 
plus tell me this doctor who was the schmuck that named this disease 
if it isnt all fatigue related why did they chose that name 
really huh 
i dont want this thing anymore 
yes 
i tried to explain more to them but i think it was too overwhelming for them 
and me 
but they are generally supportive which is great in my book 
him no siree
is something wrong honey argh is something wrong 
you know be like godzilla and stamp out the pain other times the pain is so bad all i want to do is curl into a ball and cry 
at least for me 
it would be great if we could confide in one another 
what do you think 
thats a good idea keep socializing out of the office 
now that we have essentially played the good news/bad news game ready for more good news 
or of my dreams same difference 
and science and entertainment and everything 
quiet and romantic 
okay 
bye
