she was hesitant to let go
but she did and after a few minutes i was able to compose myself and return the call
i explained to her that i had finally been given a diagnosis
then i started to explain what it all meant
it was nice to share the news with someone who really cares
yes and i am quite relieved
yes i did
i was rather shocked
he then began asking if this thing is contagious
he totally freaked and asked how i could put him in jeopardy if i knew something was wrong
i started to cry and then he got apologetic
thats when i hung up the phone
he called back and left a message on my machine
there was no way i was going to talk to him
every day he leaves another message
i have yet to call him
on the one hand i dont know if i love brian
or even if i could love him
i guess so
i didnt think about it that way
thats a pretty good idea
i wonder what it must have been like for her
i met this woman through a support group network
it is so sad
thank god for that to tell you the truth ive been thinking about finding a roommate
someone who would be able to help me out with things
in return i will give the person a great deal
what can i say sometimes the noggin actually works i wish michelle lived out here that would be perfect
doctor do you have anything to drink here i am getting a little light headed and a sip of something would do me a world of good
we have been playing phone tag mostly
i turn the ringer off on my phone when i feel like crap so i missed a couple of his calls
i heard he is going to try to attend a conference on cfids so he can better treat me
the guy has been doing research for many years and has published a lot in the scholarly journals
that is a lot of money you know just to get a diagnosis from him
if he had the cure then maybe
but just to be monitored i dont think so
i am very glad that i found you both to help me deal with my lot in life
that would be great
hey doctor
good day cassie how are you doing 
oh i guess i am hanging in another day another day 
i think so 
i think at this point it would safe to assume that the prozac is out of your system 
how was your week 
i went to the performance of winging it
that was fun though quite exhausting
within minutes of being in the theater my adrenaline began to rush through my body 
the scene was a couple in a theme restaurant and we just goofed around definitely fun afterwards there was a party 
although i was really bushed by this point i was having such fun that i didnt want the night to end 
so i joined the crowd 
anyway this pissy girl comes up to me and asks me where i have been and who do i think i am just waltzing back and onto the stage whenever i want 
this guy michael explained to her that i had an illness 
when i originally told him i wasnt sure what was wrong with me 
i decided this would be a good opportunity to come out of the closet 
she laughed and in a very snide voice said honey everyone gets a little tired from time to time 
what are you a princess needless to say i was very upset i tried in vain to explain to her as well as the rest of the group all the symptoms associated with this damned disease 
i finally gave up and just pretended that it didnt bother me 
when they laughed about it i just smiled 
to make things worse it became a running joke 
can you grab me a beer nope i have too tired and lazy syndrome i was appalled 
what did you do 
i eventually excused myself slipped out and went home 
and then i cried myself to sleep 
i guess i should sit down and read all the cdc information that dr halsey sent me 
everytime i sit down to read it i get upset and depressed 
i suppose i was thinking once i knew what was wrong with me i would feel better about things and could move on 
but it seems as though the battle is just beginning 
i told my parents 
they were puzzled and still dont know what to expect 
they kept asking if i will need surgery or chemotherapy or something radical 
he came by on sunday and made me breakfast 
it seems the worse i treat him the better he treats me 
weird 
i almost got violent with him too 
not that i am a violent person 
well i was very tired feeling awful and achy all over 
he wanted to come over for breakfast and i said i wasnt able to prepare anything he said hed do all the work 
he came over and proceeded to make a huge mess in the kitchen while making a total racket
my head was throbbing and my bones felt like they were going to explode he walks over to where i was lying down and asked me something 
actually more like demanding immediate attention 
i dont even know what he said but i was annoyed 
i just wanted to be left alone so i could get some relief 
he wouldnt let me be 
i grabbed a vase and went to bash it over his head 
halfway through my swing i stopped and just screamed at the top of my lungs do you know what he says 
sometimes when the pain gets so bad i just want to scream and break everything in sight 
my tolerance and frustration level just drops immensely after long periods of feeling really ill 
oh i am sure it will 
when i take over the counter medication it helps a little 
ive also been drinking some herbal teas recently 
i signed up for a newsletter for cfs patients and it recommends all these alternative healing techniques 
the tea tastes great but i dont think it does anything 
its soothing but anything warm to drink usually is 
well im glad that you are reaching out to a community of people suffering through similar problems and building up a support structure 
and almost anything that helps is worth trying how is work going 
okay it is difficult for me to hang in and pay attention all day long 
i almost feel as if i have this camaraderie with ms bows 
you see shes pregnant but i think i am the only one at work who knows 
im sure theres more than meets the eye there but i totally respect her need for privacy 
i almost want to tell her about the cfs thing 
i think it might be helpful if my supervisor knew what i was going through 
i dont know 
ill play it by ear 
well there is one guy who constantly mutters things under his breath 
i think hes the jerk who caused that letter in my personnel file 
anyway he said something while i was getting some coffee but i just ignored him 
if he has something up his butt thats his problem 
i am not in the mood for a big confrontational scene 
thanks for the suggestion but i really dont want to deal with him right now 
he has a major attitude to begin with hes a in your face kind of guy 
i had the dream again several times this week this guy is totally amazing 
i wish i could remember more of his face 
i have been trying to sketch him when i wake up but i cant recall anything concrete 
i do have the doodles i made when i was working on it last would you like to see them 
well in one dream we sat on a grassy hill sipping champagne 
the stars were out and the night sky was truly majestic 
it was one of those skies that look too beautiful to be real 
we were discussing literature and philosophy 
it was so delightful 
every once in awhile he would grab my hand look into my face with these incredibly smoldering eyes and smile i have the chills just thinking about it 
i know this is pretty stupid thing to ask but 
well it is possible 
but this is a fantasy cassie 
perhaps you are compensating for brian in your dreams with this mystery man 
i would like you to try something 
i would like to but i never know when i am going to crash 
that sounds fair enough
i almost didnt
but i really needed to talk
i had to take a cab over because i am not feeling all that well today
i left a message in the office and a separate one for ms bows
i really want to explain to her that i am not just loafing off 
i mean if i lose my job i lose my job
i am not quite on a lucky streak right now
but i respect her as well as admire her and i dont want to disappoint her
doctor if i lose my job will you still be able to see me 
i know i am in an hmo and that you have a special relationship with the company 
jeez it was quite crazy
michelle called because she is coming in this weekend
she had all these massive plans for us and wanted to share them with me 
she called on a very bad day for me
i couldnt think straight
she asked me if everything was okay
i feel like such a failure
well she asked me what was wrong
she then said that she hoped i would be feeling better for her visit since she had all these exciting things planned 
what could i tell her 
i dont know if i am going to get any better
i dont know if i am going to get worse
i dont think the doctors know a damned thing more than i do at this point i couldnt stop crying 
i finally asked her if i could call her back she was hesitant to let go 
but she did and after a few minutes i was able to compose myself and return the call 
i explained to her that i had finally been given a diagnosis
then i started to explain what it all meant
she always believed that when i had a diagnosis a cure or treatment would shortly follow
it was nice to share the news with someone who really cares
